### Plugins

- Packer - There is no actual reason for using packer because Plug is awesome. Packer does not open the terminal for post install hooks and I like it.
- Treesitter - Treesitter just provides a better highlighting overall. Even though Gruvbox does not officially support treesitter (if I am not wrong), it's anyways great.
- Galaxyline - The main reason for using this is that I want a simple looking statusline. Previously I was using Airline and it is too colourful for me now.
- Undotree - Sometimes you need to travel back in time with complicated undo history and undotree handles it pretty well.
- NvimTree - It has got good keybindings for instant operations on files and folders which I like.
- Completion - No particular reason for using this over any other, but it is good.
- Telescope - File navigation and custom functions are easy to build using telescope.
- Autopairs - This version is a little more conservative in the way it completes the pair.
- Startify - No particular reason at all for using this.
